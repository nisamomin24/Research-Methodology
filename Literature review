Introduction: 
The Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical and virtual objects equipped with sensors, software, and various technologies, allowing them to share data over the Internet (Altulaihan et al., 2022; Lee, 2020; Chowdhury, M et al., 2019). It begins by uniquely identifying individual objects through globally accessible identifiers. These objects, with internet connectivity, can exchange data interactively with other objects, collectively known as "things" (Tweneboah-Koduah et al., 2017). IoT has evolved beyond its initial stages and is now seen as a revolutionary technology driving the Internet's transformation into a fully integrated "Internet of Things" (IoT). This advancement is driven by the increasing adoption and integration of wireless network technologies, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, and actuating nodes (Tweneboah-Koduah et al., 2017).
By integrating various technologies, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have been conceptualized to improve efficiency of transportation, minimize accidents, enhance safety, provide diverse mobility service options, and mitigate environmental impacts (Sun et al., 2022).The adoption of the CAV paradigm is projected to advance steadily and incrementally throughout the 2020s and 2030s, driven by enhancements in infrastructure and communication technologies. CAVsâ€™s global market is burgeoning and anticipated to become one of the largest markets worldwide, with estimations suggesting it could reach a value of $7 trillion by 2050 (Sun et al., 2022). The widespread proliferation of connected devices within the IoT has generated significant demand for strong security measures. This is in response to the increasing need to safeguard millions, if not billions, of connected devices and services worldwide (Abomhara & Koien, 2015). Implementing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in real-world environments is significantly challenged by security risks. As Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) manage larger volumes of data and sensitive information, the exchange of data between vehicles raises the potential for security risks for users. These risks may take different forms, including attacks on vehicle-to-everything networks, in-vehicle network breaches, data storage vulnerabilities, machine learning system exploitation, manipulation attempts, and targeted assaults on passwords and encryption keys (Karuppiah et al., 2024). 
Addressing and mitigating all types of attacks can indeed pose challenges for automotive designers, leading to complexities in the design process (Karuppiah et al., 2024).


Significance of the research:

The Architecture of IoT in CAVs:
The architecture of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) comprises multiple layers, each serving specific functions and presenting distinct security challenges.
Chowdhury, Islam, and Khan (2019) emphasize the importance of real-time monitoring and detection of suspicious activities in CAVs through the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). They highlight the significance of securing the Perception Layer, which includes sensors like cameras, radar, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors. Security risks in this layer encompass issues with wireless sensor connectivity, physical tampering of sensor nodes, and vulnerabilities due to resource constraints. In contrast, Altulaihan et al. (2022) shed light on the Business Layer, which oversees the overall CAV ecosystem, managing applications, business models, and user privacy policies.
The Network Layer, responsible for transmitting data and enabling communication between vehicles, roadside units, and servers, is susceptible to various attacks, as identified by Lee (2020). These include denial of service, eavesdropping on communications, and traffic analysis. Furthermore, Altulaihan et al. (2022) underscore the importance of user data privacy and authentication mechanism consistency across applications at the Application Layer. However, Tweneboah-Koduah et al. (2017) argue that the Application Layer also faces challenges related to performance impacts from numerous connected vehicles.
Addressing security threats at the Transport Layer is crucial, as outlined by Lee (2020). Threats in this layer include de-synchronization attacks, flooding attacks, insecure data transit, and scalable key management issues. Similarly, Altulaihan et al. (2022) emphasize the need for robust security measures tailored to the CAV environment to ensure safe and reliable operation. Additionally, Karuppiah et al. (2024) discuss the significance of securing the Processing Layer, which analyzes and processes large volumes of real-time data from sensors. They highlight the integration of information from lower layers to make driving decisions, utilizing cloud computing and big data processing capabilities.
 
Cybersecurity attacks on the CAVs:
Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are complex systems composed of various layers and components that work together to enable autonomous driving capabilities. However, each layer and component are vulnerable to different types of cyber-attacks that can potentially impact the overall security and safety of the CAV system. The table below outlines the different types of attacks that CAVs may face, their potential impacts, and the specific layers or components that could be targeted by these attacks. Understanding these attack vectors is crucial for developing robust security measures and safeguarding the integrity of CAV systems.
