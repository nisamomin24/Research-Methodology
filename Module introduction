The module also aims to develop my professional skills necessary for presenting and disseminating research findings. This includes training in academic writing, critical evaluation of existing literature, and effective communication strategies for diverse audiences. By the end of the course, I am expected to demonstrate a robust understanding of research methodologies and the ability to apply these principles in real-world scenarios. This ensures that my work contributes positively to my field and adheres to high ethical standards.
